This proposed algorithm can offer a secure way transmission between any nodes in network topology. 
We propose modification to the AODV protocol and justify the solution with implementation and simulation 
using NS-2.33. Our analysis shows the significant improvement in end-to-end delay, throughput, 
and packet delivery ratio of AODV in presence of Black hole attack

V. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION
The solution that we have proposed here is that we develop black hole AODV which allows some degree of 
node maliciousness to give an motivation to selfish nodes to state its malicious behavior to its neighbors 
which decreases searching time of misbehaving nodes. In proposed model the trust among nodes is represented 
by trust score. 
 
 The trust calculation is based on packets loss rate 
 
 if data packet is successfully transmitted then node trust value is incremented by 1, 
 otherwise it becomes zero.
